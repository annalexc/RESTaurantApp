### High-Level User Stories
_**As an end user, I want to be able to...**_
- Efficiently keep track of orders per table with as little error as possible, so that I can deliver the requested orders
- Expedite the process of delivering what is ordered in the most efficient manner
- Turn over tables quickly, and thus increase the amount of people that can be served
- Quickly add and update menu items as needed

### Design Considerations
1. **Mobile Responsive Design:** Because the target end user would likely need this app to be avaialble on smaller devices (to accommodate a busy, ever-changing environment), my first priority was to design "mobile-first". I opted for a clean, uncluttered design with larger, easy to identify "touch" elements and interaction points.
2. **Ease of Navigation:** I wanted to minimize the number of navigational screens and largely simplify/consolidate the steps required to create a party and compile customer orders. I decided to incorporate:
    * A visual representation of available and unavailable tables for party assignment
    * An interactive breadcrumb menu during order creation 
    * The ability to quickly iterate through customer orders for a given party
